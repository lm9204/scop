# Render 3D Object File
> A lightweight 3D object renderer for `.obj` files with basic transformation and texturing capabilities.

## Features
- **Parse `.obj` files**: Efficiently loads and parses 3D object data stored in Wavefront `.obj` format.
- **Rotation**: Rotate the object along its primary symmetrical axes.
- **Translation**: Move the object along the X, Y, and Z axes.
- **Texture Application**: Apply textures to the 3D object via drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Shader Support**: Enhances the visual quality of objects with custom shaders for lighting and rendering effects.

## Installation
Clone this repository and ensure you have the required dependencies to run the program.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lm9204/scop.git
cd scop

...
```

### Usage
	1. Load an .obj file into the program.
	2. Use the controls to:
		Rotate the object along its symmetrical axes.
		Move the object in 3D space.
	3. Drag and drop a texture file onto the interface to apply it to the object.
	4. Experiment with the shader settings for enhanced visual effects.
